# Emotional Support Chatbot ðŸ¤–ðŸ’–  

## Overview  
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the creation of an **Emotional Support Chatbot**. The chatbot is designed to:  
1. Understand the user's emotional state using sentiment analysis and emotion detection.  
2. Respond in a manner that reflects empathy and emotional understanding.  

This project showcases the integration of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and machine learning models to build a chatbot capable of emotional intelligence.
